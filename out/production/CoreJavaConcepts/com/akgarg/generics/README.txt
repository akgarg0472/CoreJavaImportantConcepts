→ Generics is an abstraction over types.
→ Generics means parameterized types.
→ Using generics, we can define classes or methods that can be used with multiple types of Objects.
→ Primitive data type is not allowed in the generic parameter.
→ One of the best advantage of using generics is the code re-usability.
→ Generics also helps to type safety of data inserted.
→ Syntax:
    - Generic class syntax
        class ClassName<T> {}
    - Generic method syntax
        public <T> methodName(T parameterName) {}
